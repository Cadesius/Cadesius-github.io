<p style="text-align: left;" class="BODY">Gwen Burnell was one of those rare things, somebody who lived in Wootton Courtenay all her life. Her parents farmed at Fairgarden and she worked with her father after she left school. She loved farming, and hunting, and dogs, and had always been an outdoor person. She rode the same pony to the opening meet for 17 years. She stayed on the farm as a land girl during the war, when they had three evacuee children, and met her husband at a benefit dance in Exford.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" class="BODY">She thought that people don't know what work is nowadays and had no time at all for the National Park or National Trust. They don't burn the moorland enough any more and the heather and gorse have got too high. Her husband set fire to Dunkery one night, in protest. You wouldn't do it nowadays, she said, somebody would come along.</p>
