<p style="text-align: left;" class="BODY">Arthur Heywood's family have been at Harewood Farm for over 150 years. He lost nearly 100 acres of his land to Wimbleball reservoir and now lives with the perimeter fence only a stone's throw away.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" class="BODY">He went to Brompton Regis school and then on to board at a county school. In the holidays he shot, took photographs, and cycled miles. After school and agricultural college he came back to run the farm and battle with the planning authorities as he tried to develop the tourist side of the business.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" class="BODY">He believes that people who live and work in the country are thought of as second class and thinks that perhaps he shouldn't have been a farmer; his daughter Caroline is better with animals than he is. He is a family man. He says that if you are comfortable with yourself there's no need to mix with other people all the time.</p>
