<h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>

<p class="BODY">South West Heritage Trust was founded in 2014 as an independent charity for Somerset, Devon and the South West. We want to celebrate and protect our rich heritage, helping everyone to enjoy it now and in the future. We bring together services previously provided by Somerset and Devon County Councils, who remain our main funders.</p>
<p class="BODY">Operating across six main sites, we deliver a wide range of heritage experiences for people of all ages. We work with many local and strategic partners, including Arts Council England and the Heritage Lottery Fund.</p>

<h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>

Together they tell the remarkable story of Somerset and the South West. We care for over 3 million museum objects ranging from outstanding geology and archaeology to textiles and fine art.</p>

More than 350,000 printed reference works about Somerset and Devon are also held in the Local Studies collections. Together they are essential resources for anyone wanting to begin a journey through the history of the South West.</p>
